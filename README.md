This project is my bachelor's thesis and my first experience creating Convolutional Neural Network. The goal of the project is to recognize the voice of my family members, which I recorded myself.
## Technologies used in this project: 
1. Python 
2. Pandas for creation training and test data
3. Numpy for math calculations
4. Tensorflow/Keras for building model of CNN
5. Librosa for sound processing
6. TKinter for creating user interface
7. Jupyter Notebook as IDE
## Result
The result of my project is a window app with which the user can select file and get the recognition result.
